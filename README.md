# Intra Cluster Filtering

## Installation Instructions

We recommend creating an environment for the installation of the library.

### Step 1: Create a New Environment

First, create a new environment:

```sh
# Create a new environment
python -m venv YourRepository

# Activate the environment
# On Windows
.\YourRepository\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux
source YourRepository/bin/activate
```
### Step 2: Install Git

It is necessary to have Git installed for this installation. If you don't have Git installed, you can download it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

### Step 3: Install the Package

In your console (e.g., Anaconda Prompt), execute the following commands:
```sh
# Activate your environment
conda activate YourRepository

# Install the package from GitHub
pip install git+https://github.com/juanzamorai/intracluster-filtering.git
```

Once the installation is complete, you can start using the library. We recommend checking out the examples in the [`examples`](https://github.com/juanzamorai/intracluster-filtering/tree/main/examples) folder.
